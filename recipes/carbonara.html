<h3>Spaghetti carbonara, a pasta and sauce rich with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and guanciale, pancetta</h3>
<p>This dish satisfies everyone in the family.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li> tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>6 ounces thickly sliced guanciale, pancetta, or bacon/li>
    <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
    <li>3 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk (well beaten)</li>

</ul>
<h4>steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.  </li>
    <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.  </li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.  </li>
    <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set </li>
    <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table. </li>
</ol>
